# Getting Started with React + Vite

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), using the official [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react) plugin.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the production build locally.  
Useful for testing the production version before deploying.
